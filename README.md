# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation. This project is a simple, interactive game where two players can compete against each other.

## How to Play

1.  The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2.  One player is X, and the other is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3.  The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4.  When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

*   A 3x3 game board.
*   Two-player gameplay (Player X and Player O).
*   Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
*   Detection of a draw game.
*   A reset button to start a new game.
